            "Seven Pounds" is a 2008 drama film that revolves around the main character, played by Will Smith, who plays
            the role of Ben Thomas, a man with a dark secret that drives him to seek forgiveness through acts of
            kindness and selflessness.

            This platform is designed to offer a unique and detailed view of the temporal evolution of the importance of
            key characters within the plot, taking advantage of a sophisticated line graph distinctively arranged within
            a jellyfish.

            Through an immersive visual experience, we invite you to explore the complexity of the relationships and
            dynamics of the protagonists throughout the film. Each tentacle of the jellyfish represents a character. The
            length and thickness of the line that accurately reflects the actor's role and importance at a particular
            stage of the story.
            Our goal is to offer a unique and in-depth perspective on the plot, allowing you to grasp the nuances of the
            interactions between the protagonists and appreciate their individual growth over the course of the
            narrative.
